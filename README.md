# Installation

## Mik Compiler (mic)
To install the mik compiler, clone the repo and:
```
cd SimpleMikCPP/MikCompiler
```

Then run either:
```
make
```

or 

```
<c_compiler> nob.c -o nob && ./nob
```

The second option is a no-build tool, meaning that make is not required and a c and c++ compiler is all you need to build from source!
